This repository contains: 

- The whole genome *Sarbecovirus* [alignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spyros-lytras/SC2_origins_rec/main/78sarbeco_wgal_fn.fas) associated with the paper.
	- NB: 4 sequences have been masked in accordance with GISAID's data sharing policy.

- The whole genome *Sarbecovirus* [non-recombinant alignment](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spyros-lytras/SC2_origins_rec/main/78sarbeco_wgal_fn_RDP5norec.fas) based on the RDP5 analysis (Figure 1A).
	- NB: 4 sequences have been masked in accordance with GISAID's data sharing policy.
	
- The putatively non-recombinant [phylogenies](https://github.com/spyros-lytras/SC2_origins_rec/blob/main/78sarbeco_alltree_fn.json) described in the paper.
	- these can be interactively explored in the associated [Observable Notebook](https://observablehq.com/@spyros-lytras/sc2_origins_rec).

- The breakpoint [positions](https://github.com/spyros-lytras/SC2_origins_rec/blob/main/Table_S3.csv) detected using the GARD method.
